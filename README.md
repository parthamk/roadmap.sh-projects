## Roadmap.sh Practise Projects

Here I practise and share old concepts of developments you can follow and check the codes.

I am using only one repository for all the projects so that everything is avaliable in one repository.

### My first Project
Frontend_Projects > Beginner > Single-Page-CV
Project page URL
- Single-Page HTML CV Project
  - The project instruction: [Single-Page HTML CV Project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv)
    - [x] [Single-Page HTML CV Project](https://github.com/parthamk/roadmap.sh-projects/tree/main/Frontend_Projects/Beginner/Single-Page-CV)
